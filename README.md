This website demonstrates some key powers of the programming language, R, in its application to data science for business applications. 

The website contains six hubs that are featured by coloured tiles under an overarching introduction to the author.

Five of the hubs demonstrate key applications of R in data science for business:

(a) data manipulation

(b) data visualisation

(c) data analytics

(d) machine learning

(e) databases

The sixth hub highlights key features of R that make it a particularly excellent programming language. Indeed, it is unparalleled
by other programming languages in many of these regards.

I hope that this website is helpful to the reader. Thanks for reading! Jacqui
