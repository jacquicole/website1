If you have ever coded in other programming languages, then you will appreciate the great benefits of R (or if you are lucky to have chosen your first language to be R, then congratulations - look no further!). Here are a few key benefits of R:

(i) It can produce amazing visualisation of data.

(ii) It is great at automatic data cleaning.

(iii) It is the most comprehensive programming language for statistics.

(iv) It is open source and developed by the community for the community. 

(v) It is super fast to learn.
