# Money in UK politics

[The Westminster Accounts](https://news.sky.com/story/the-westminster-accounts-12786091), a recent collaboration between Sky News and Tortoise Media, examines the flow of money through UK politics. It does so by combining data from three key sources:

1.  [Register of Members' Financial Interests](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-members-financial-interests/),
2.  [Electoral Commission records of donations to parties](http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Search/Donations), and
3.  [Register of All-Party Parliamentary Groups](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-all-party-party-parliamentary-groups/).

You can [search and explore the results](https://news.sky.com/story/westminster-accounts-search-for-your-mp-or-enter-your-full-postcode-12771627) through the collaboration's interactive database. Simon Willison [has extracted a database](https://til.simonwillison.net/shot-scraper/scraping-flourish) and this is what we will be working with. If you want to read more about [the project's methodology](https://www.tortoisemedia.com/2023/01/08/the-westminster-accounts-methodology/).

## Open a connection to the database

The database made available by Simon Willison is an `SQLite` database

```{r}
sky_westminster <- DBI::dbConnect(
  drv = RSQLite::SQLite(),
  dbname = here::here("data", "sky-westminster-files.db")
)
```

How many tables does the database have?

```{r}
DBI::dbListTables(sky_westminster)

# The database has 7 tables according to the results of running this DBI request.
```

## Which MP has received the most amount of money?

You need to work with the `payments` and `members` tables and for now we just want the total among all years. To insert a new, blank chunk of code where you can write your beautiful code (and comments!), please use the following shortcut: `Ctrl + Alt + I` (Windows) or `cmd + option + I` (mac)

```{r}
# Read in the relevant tables as dataframes

payments <-  dplyr::tbl(sky_westminster, "payments")
members <-  dplyr::tbl(sky_westminster, "members")
parties <-  dplyr::tbl(sky_westminster, "parties")

#calculate which MP has received the most money

payments %>% 
  group_by(member_id) %>%
  summarise(maxvalue = sum(value)) %>%
  left_join(members, by = c("member_id" = "id")) %>% #joint payments and members with the common MP id to resolve the identity of the MPs.
  arrange(desc(maxvalue)) # arrange dataframe in descending value.

# The MP to receive the most money is now in the top row of the resulting table, i.e. it is Teresa May who receives £2809765.42.
```

## Any `entity` that accounts for more than 5% of all donations?

Is there any `entity` whose donations account for more than 5% of the total payments given to MPs over the 2020-2022 interval? Who are they and who did they give money to?

```{r}
# Read in the relevant tables as dataframes

payments <-  dplyr::tbl(sky_westminster, "payments")
members <-  dplyr::tbl(sky_westminster, "members")

#First define and apply the range of year restriction

payments %>%
  
#capture the last 4 chars of the date variable as these contain the year in xxxx format. 
  
  mutate(year = str_sub(date, -4)) %>% 
  
#specify the year range 2020-2022 (note that the years only go up to 2022 so this is all that is necessary)  
  
  filter(year >= 2020) %>% 
  
#Now calculate the total value of all payments from entity (donor) to  member_ids (MPs). One needs to group and then ungroup so that this does not restrict the code that follows.
  
  group_by(entity,member_id) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(value)) %>%
  ungroup %>%

#Now resolve the identity of the member_id by joining to the dataframe for members which contains the name of the MPs which we can link to their id which is equivalent to member_id in the dataframe for payments.
  
  left_join(members, by = c("member_id" = "id")) %>%

#Now arrange the values in descending order and collect to that one can see if any donors have given more than 5 percent of the total payments.
  
    arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  collect() %>%

#Remove two rogue rows of data that contain errors.  

  filter(!str_detect(entity, 'Country Foods'))  %>%
  filter(!str_detect(entity, 'George Watson'))  %>%

#Calculate the percentage mentioned above.
  
  mutate(percent=round(100*total/sum(total),digits=2)) %>%
  
#Select the columns of interest and show the results in a table.  

  select(entity,name,party_id,total,percent)

# The results in the table reveal that one entity accounts for more than 5 percent of all donations. The entity in question is WithersLLP who donate to the Conservative MP (party_id = p4), Sir Geoffrey Cox (name) a total value of 1,812,731.81 which is 5.26 percent of the total amount of donations.

```

## Do `entity` donors give to a single party or not?

-   How many distinct entities who paid money to MPS are there?

```{r}
#Read in the relevant data table into a dataframe

payments <-  dplyr::tbl(sky_westminster, "payments")

payments %>%
  summarise(Unique_Elements = n_distinct(entity)) # Now summarise with unique elements 

payments %>%
  summarise(Unique_Elements = n_distinct(member_id)) # Now summarise with unique elements 


#These results indicate that there are 2213 distinct entity (donors) and only 595 distinct member_id (MPs).
```

-   How many (as a number and %) donated to MPs belonging to a single party only?

    ```{r}
    # First convert the database tables into dataframes

    payments <-  dplyr::tbl(sky_westminster, "payments")
    parties <-  dplyr::tbl(sky_westminster, "parties")
    members <-  dplyr::tbl(sky_westminster, "members")

    # Then stitch together the columns of three dataframes where they are sequentially joined by the id of the MP or party name. 

    mempay <- payments %>%
      left_join(members, by = c("member_id" = "id")) 

    parmempay <- mempay %>%
      left_join(parties, by = c("party_id" = "id"))

    # Checking the result:

    parmempay %>%
      glimpse

    # This puts together the three key columns that need to be compared which are entity and abbrev and member_id. Now we can calculate how many entity donate to MPs belonging to only a single party:
    #
    # First, we determine how many party_id and abbrev are distinct:
    #
    parmempay %>%
          summarise(Unique_Elements = n_distinct(party_id)) # Now     
    #     summarise with unique elements 

    parmempay %>%
          summarise(Unique_Elements = n_distinct(member_id)) # Now     
    #     summarise with unique elements 

    #These results show that there are only 13 distinct party_ids and only 13 distinct parties. Since each member_id has a particular party_id, and we expect an MP to be a member of only one party, this makes sense. But this isn't proof about the link between member_id and party_id uniqueness as a correlation. It's just an indication. So, the following code and analysis was undertaken to prove this:

    #Read back in my merged dataframe containing all the relevant columns and collect data from the database 
    parmempay %>%
      collect() %>%
      
    # Filter out two rows with these two lines of codes. These rows were found to contain errors when running this segment of code without them, and the nature of the code errors uncovered the text entry inconsistencies in these two rows. So, these two lines of code were added to find and remove these two rows: 
      
      filter(!str_detect(entity, 'Andrew Taylor'))  %>%
      filter(!str_detect(entity, 'Le Manoir aux Quat'))  %>%

    # The three relevant columns were then selected, where their relationships may be deduced counting how many rows they have in common, as this tells us to what extent these variables map to each other with a one-to-one correpondence and are thus distinct, or whether there is multiplicity in intervariable mapping. 
      
        select(entity,member_id,abbrev) %>%
      group_by(entity,member_id,abbrev) %>%

    # First, we group together all three variables and by just looking at the size of the tibble i.e. y where tibble has dimensions of y x 3, y reveals the number of possible combinations of each variable. Considering all three together gives us a base line (y = 4090). We then have to ungroup this group in order to do the next relationship test and continuing to add code that groups other variables:
      
      ungroup %>%
      
    # I now group member_id and abbrev to check the indication made above that all MPs will be loyal to a single party. We know from the previous question that there are 595 distinct MPs in this dataframe so if the possible combinations (mapping) of MPs and party types is the same (i.e. 595) then they have a one-to-one correspondence, and this proofs the indication above. Let's see - we now group - check the dimension, y, of the tibble that the grouping generates via this R code and then compares it against the number of distinct 595 MPs:
      
      group_by(member_id,abbrev) %>% #proof that MPs stick to one party
      ungroup %>%

    # The full analysis is given below but this grouping shows all MPs to be loyal to their party, as we had suspected. These variables were then ungrouped so that we could start a new grouping.
      
    # Entity (donors) and abbrev (party types) are now grouped, to see how many combinations exists between them.
      
      group_by(entity,abbrev) %>%  #this produces 2467 relationships.
      ungroup %>% # I then ungroup this group so that I can make another
      
    # We already saw in the solution to the previous question that there are a total of 2213 distinct entity values (i.e. distinct donors). We lost a few rows in filtering out two cases with data entry inconsistencies. So we just check this value again to be sure:
      
      group_by(entity)
    #
    # This all checked out as we expect: y = 2211 i.e. as per the solution to the previous question but two less because I have filtered out two rows in the above analysis.
    # 
    # The overall data analysis provides these findings and conclusions:
    #
    # The results of these groupings and monitoring the associated y values in the y x 3 dimensions of the tibble of variables that have been grouped in different ways, shows that there are:
    #
    # 10,537 total rows of entity, member_id, abbrev
    # 4090 distinct combinations of entity, member_id, abbrev
    # 595 distinct combinations of member_id and abbrev
    # 2467 entity distinct combinations of abbrev rows
    # 2211 rows of entity values (in the previous question, we determined this value to be 2213 which is consistent with this new value when we consider that we removed two rows of data from the dataframe parmempay to overcome a few errors in data entry).
    #
    # These all show that all MPs are entirely loyal to one party (there are 595 distinct MPs and 595 combinations of MPs and Party categories, so this proves that there is a one-to-one mapping between them).
    #
    # But are donors to MPs as loyal to a party?
    #
    # It would seem that they are largely so, but not entirely so, because there are more mappings of donors (entity) to party names (abbrev) than there are distinct donors (entity) to the tune of:
    #2467-2211 = 256 (regarding the two entries that were filtered out owing to errors, I checked manually the cases of Andrew Taylor and Le Manoir aux Quat and they were found to be loyal to one party).
    #
    # The numer of entity that donated to a single party can thus be calculated to be:
    # 
    # 2213
    #
    # which is a percentage:
    #
    # (2213/2467)*100 = 89.7 percent of donors are loyal to a single party in making their donations.

    ```

## Which party has raised the greatest amount of money in each of the years 2020-2022?

```{r}
# Convert relevant data tables into dataframes

party_donations <-  dplyr::tbl(sky_westminster, "party_donations")
parties <-  dplyr::tbl(sky_westminster, "parties")

#Determine the total number of donations and place in descending order

total_party_donations <- party_donations %>%   
group_by(date, party_id) %>%   
summarise(total_donations = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%   
ungroup() %>%
arrange(desc(total_donations)) %>%   
  
# join parties to party_donations in order to resolve identities of the parties with the donors, and then collect the data  
  
left_join(parties, by = c("party_id"="id")) %>%   
collect() %>%   
  
# Resolve the value of the year from the date variable that is given
  
mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(date), #lubridate doesn't work on DB directly-- need to collect first         
year = year(date)) %>%   
  
# Determine the proportion of the total number of donations per year with respect to the total value of the donations and arrange the results in descending order
  
group_by(year, name) %>%   
summarise(total_year_donations = sum(total_donations)) %>%   
mutate(prop = total_year_donations / sum(total_year_donations)) %>%   
ungroup() %>%
arrange(desc(prop))

# Display the resulting dataframe

total_party_donations

#This table shows that the conservative (C) party obtains the dominant portion of the donations, with labour (Lab) second and, depending on the year, the liberal democrats (LD), Sinn Fein (SF) , the Scottish National Party (SNP) are third with the combination of other parties (O) making up the rest. By year, this summarises as:

#2020: C (61%), Lab (19%), LD (18%), O (2%)
#2021: C (59%), Lab (32%), SF (3%), LD (2%), SNP (2%), O (2%)
#2022: C (56%), Lab (34%), LD (6%), O (4%).

#Thus, the conservative party progressively lost their donations from 2020-2022 while the labour party gained in this market share, while the liberal democrats lost nearly all support, only recovering slightly in 2022.


```

I would like you to write code that generates the following table.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "total_donations_table.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
#Now reordering the table in the manner requested by the question below to match that of total_donations_table.png in the images folder:

total_party_donations[order(total_party_donations$year,total_party_donations$name), ]
```

... and then, based on this data, plot the following graph.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "total_donations_graph.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(scales) # a library for the graphing options
total_party_donations %>% #read in the dataframe
  arrange(year) %>% #arrange data such that year is in ascending order

# This classifies the main parties and groups the minor ones into other

      mutate(recode_name  = case_when(
     name %in% c("Conservative") ~ "Conservative",
     name %in% c("Labour") ~ "Labour",
     name %in% c("Liberal Demoncrats") ~ "Liberal Democrats",
     name %in% c("Sinn Féin") ~ "Sinn Féin",
     name %in% c("Scottish National Party") ~ "Scottish National Party",
     TRUE ~ "Other"
   )) %>% 

# I now plot the data as side-by-side bar chart whose magnitude is in decreasing order and with titles and labels to aid visualisation:
    
  ggplot(mapping = aes(year, total_year_donations, fill = recode_name)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(), alpha = 0.75) + labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = "Conservatives have captured the majority of political donations", subtitle = "Donations to political parties, 2020-2022", fill = "Party") + theme(plot.title = element_text(size=9),plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8)) + scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)

```

This uses the default ggplot colour pallete, as I dont want you to worry about using the [official colours for each party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Index_of_United_Kingdom_political_parties_meta_attributes). However, I would like you to ensure the parties are sorted according to total donations and not alphabetically. You may even want to remove some of the smaller parties that hardly register on the graph. Would facetting help you?

Finally, when you are done working with the databse, make sure you close the connection, or disconnect from the database.

```{r}
dbDisconnect(sky_westminster) #disconnecting from the database
```

# Anonymised Covid patient data from the CDC

We will be using a dataset with [anonymous Covid-19 patient data that the CDC publishes every month](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4). The file we will use was released on April 11, 2023, and has data on 98 million of patients, with 19 features. This file cannot be loaded in memory, but luckily we have the data in `parquet` format and we will use the `{arrow}` package.

## Obtain the data

The dataset `cdc-covid-geography` in in `parquet` format that {arrow}can handle. It is \> 600Mb and too large to be hosted on Canvas or Github, so please download it from dropbox <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q1yk8mmnbbrzavl/AAAxzRtIhag9Nc_hODafGV2ka?dl=0> and save it in your `dsb` repo, under the `data` folder

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false


tic() # start timer
cdc_data <- open_dataset(here::here("data", "cdc-covid-geography"))
toc() # stop timer

#This dataset could be read in BUT my computer was out of memory when it tried to show a 'glimpse' of the data. So I have commented out the glimpse command below and I thus can't work on this dataset.
#
#FYI, the error that I obtain by using the command:
#
#glimpse(cdc_data)
#
# is : Error: Out of memory: realloc of size 268435456 failed 
#
```

Can you query the database and replicate the following plot?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid-CFR-ICU.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The previous plot is an aggregate plot for all three years of data. What if we wanted to plot Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) over time? Write code that collects the relevant data from the database and plots the following

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cfr-icu-overtime.png"), error = FALSE)
```

For each patient, the dataframe also lists the patient's states and county [FIPS code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard_state_code). The CDC also has information on the [NCHS Urban-Rural classification scheme for counties](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm)

```{r}
urban_rural <- read_xlsx(here::here("data", "NCHSURCodes2013.xlsx")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 
```

Each county belongs in seix diffent categoreis, with categories 1-4 being urban areas and categories 5-6 being rural, according to the following criteria captured in `x2013_code`

Category name

1.  Large central metro - 1 million or more population and contains the entire population of the largest principal city
2.  large fringe metro - 1 million or more poulation, but does not qualify as 1
3.  Medium metro - 250K - 1 million population
4.  Small metropolitan population \< 250K
5.  Micropolitan
6.  Noncore

Can you query the database, extract the relevant information, and reproduce the following two graphs that look at the Case Fatality ratio (CFR) in different counties, according to their population?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cfr-county-population.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cfr-rural-urban.png"), error = FALSE)
```

# Money in US politics

In the United States, [*"only American citizens (and immigrants with green cards) can contribute to federal politics, but the American divisions of foreign companies can form political action committees (PACs) and collect contributions from their American employees."*](https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs)

We will scrape and work with data foreign connected PACs that donate to US political campaigns. The data for foreign connected PAC contributions in the 2022 election cycle can be found at <https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2022>. Then, we will use a similar approach to get data such contributions from previous years so that we can examine trends over time.

All data come from [OpenSecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org), a *"website tracking the influence of money on U.S. politics, and how that money affects policy and citizens' lives"*.

```{r}
#| label: allow-scraping-opensecrets
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(robotstxt) # checking the the website allows us to scrape data
paths_allowed("https://www.opensecrets.org")

# Reading in the website URL and creating an associated dataframe:

base_url <- "https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2022"

contributions_tables <- base_url %>%
  read_html() 

```

-   First, make sure you can scrape the data for 2022. Use janitor::clean_names() to rename variables scraped using `snake_case` naming.

    ```{r}
    #
       base_url <- "https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2022"

      tables <- base_url %>%# get tables that exist on url  
      read_html() %>%  
      html_nodes(css="table") %>% # this will isolate all tables on page  
      html_table() # Parse an html table into a dataframe table

      ## Use `tables[[1]]` to parse the first table (for 2022)
    contributions <-  tables[[1]] %>%   
    janitor::clean_names() #%>%    #default option is snake_case
    #data.frame(years = years(1:215))
    #mutate(newCol(1:215) = year)
      #
    #This converts the table headers into snake_case e.g. pac_name_affiliate
    #
    #Add a year column (for later)
    #
    #mutate(year=year)
    ```

-   Clean the data:

    -   Write a function that converts contribution amounts in `total`, `dems`, and `repubs` from character strings to numeric values.
    -   Separate the `country_of_origin_parent_company` into two such that country and parent company appear in different columns for country-level analysis.

```{r}
# write a function to parse_currency
parse_currency <- function(x){
  x %>%
    
    # remove dollar signs
    str_remove("\\$") %>%
    
    # remove all occurrences of commas
    str_remove_all(",") %>%
    
    # convert to numeric
    as.numeric()
}

# clean country/parent co and contributions 
contributions <- contributions %>%
  separate(country_of_origin_parent_company, 
           into = c("country", "parent"), 
           sep = "/", 
           extra = "merge") %>%
  mutate(
    total = parse_currency(total),
    dems = parse_currency(dems),
    repubs = parse_currency(repubs)
  )
```

-   Write a function called `scrape_pac()` that scrapes information from the Open Secrets webpage for foreign-connected PAC contributions in a given year. This function should

    -   have one input: the URL of the webpage and should return a data frame.
    -   add a new column to the data frame for `year`. We will want this information when we ultimately have data from all years, so this is a good time to keep track of it. Our function doesn't take a year argument, but the year is embedded in the URL, so we can extract it out of there, and add it as a new column. Use the `str_sub()` function to extract the last 4 characters from the URL. You will probably want to look at the help for this function to figure out how to specify "last 4 characters".

-   Define the URLs for 2022, 2020, and 2000 contributions. Then, test your function using these URLs as inputs. Does the function seem to do what you expected it to do?

-   Construct a vector called `urls` that contains the URLs for each webpage that contains information on foreign-connected PAC contributions for a given year.

-   Map the `scrape_pac()` function over `urls` in a way that will result in a data frame called `contributions_all`.

-   Write the data frame to a csv file called `contributions-all.csv` in the `data` folder.

# Scraping consulting jobs

The website [https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/](https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs) lists job openings for consulting jobs.

```{r}
#| label: consulting_jobs_url


library(robotstxt)
paths_allowed("https://www.consultancy.uk") #is it ok to scrape?

base_url <- "https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/1"

listings_html <- base_url %>%
  read_html()

```

Identify the CSS selectors in order to extract the relevant information from this page, namely

1.  job
2.  firm
3.  functional area
4.  type

Can you get all pages of ads, and not just the first one, [`https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/1`](https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/1) into a dataframe?

-   Write a function called `scrape_jobs()` that scrapes information from the webpage for consulting positions. This function should

    -   have one input: the URL of the webpage and should return a data frame with four columns (variables): job, firm, functional area, and type

    -   Test your function works with other pages too, e.g., <https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/2>. Does the function seem to do what you expected it to do?

    -   Given that you have to scrape `...jobs/page/1`, `...jobs/page/2`, etc., define your URL so you can join multiple stings into one string, using `str_c()`. For instnace, if `page` is 5, what do you expect the following code to produce?

```         
base_url <- "https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/1"
url <- str_c(base_url, page)
```

-   Construct a vector called `pages` that contains the numbers for each page available

-   Map the `scrape_jobs()` function over `pages` in a way that will result in a data frame called `all_consulting_jobs`.

-   Write the data frame to a csv file called `all_consulting_jobs.csv` in the `data` folder.

```{r}
#
# NB: A practical point: I progressively work through the development of the above questions throughout this code block. 
#
#The resulting code that defines the final function and so forth is provided at the end of this code block.
#
#
#
# Initial test work to develop the underpinning code ideas towards the function development:- working through the first two questions:

#This function will have one input: the URL of the webpage and should return a data frame with four columns (variables): job, firm, functional area, and type

#Test your function works with other pages too, e.g., https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/2. Does the function seem to do what you expected it to do?

# I tackle the above two questions in one set of code, whereby I input all 5 pages of the website tabular information sequentially:

base_url1 <- "https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/1"
base_url2 <- "https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/2"
base_url3 <- "https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/3"
base_url4 <- "https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/4"
base_url5 <- "https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/5"


# I then isolate all (in this case 1) table on each of the five pages and parse each table into a dataframe

table1 <- base_url1 %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(css="table") %>% # this will isolate all tables on page
  html_table() # Parse an html table into a dataframe

table2 <- base_url2 %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(css="table") %>% # this will isolate all tables on page
  html_table() # Parse an html table into a dataframe

table3 <- base_url3 %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(css="table") %>% # this will isolate all tables on page
  html_table() # Parse an html table into a dataframe

table4 <- base_url4 %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(css="table") %>% # this will isolate all tables on page
  html_table() # Parse an html table into a dataframe

table5 <- base_url5 %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(css="table") %>% # this will isolate all tables on page
  html_table() # Parse an html table into a dataframe

#This produces 5 dataframes of the five tables from the 5 pages:

table1
table2
table3
table4
table5

# Now I develop the more sophisticated approach with the next two questions:

#Given that you have to scrape ...jobs/page/1, ...jobs/page/2, etc., define your URL so you can join multiple stings into one string, using str_c(). For instnace, if page is 5, what do you expect the following code to produce?

#base_url <- "https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/1"
#url <- str_c(base_url, page)

#Construct a vector called pages that contains the numbers for each page available

base_url <- "https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/"
page = c(1,2,3,4,5)
url <- str_c(base_url, page)
url

job <- listings_html %>%    
html_nodes(css = "span.title") %>%    
html_text2()     

firm <- listings_html %>%    
html_nodes(css = ".hide-phone .row-link") %>%    
html_text2()

functionality <- listings_html %>%    
html_nodes(css = ".hide-tablet-and-less .row-link") %>%    
html_text2()

jobtype <- listings_html %>%    
html_nodes(css = ".hide-tablet-landscape .row-link") %>%    
html_text2()

job
firm
functionality
jobtype

# This has provided me a way to collect the five pages into one 'url'

# Now I try to work on the creation of the actual function cf the question:

#Map the scrape_jobs() function over pages in a way that will result in a data frame called all_consulting_jobs.


#############################################################

# turn our code into a function

# we now have the tibble, so this is what the function should return

}

# iterate across pages 1-5
page <- 1:5

# use purrr::map_df(), as we want the output to be a dataframe
all_consulting_jobs <- map_df(page, get_listings)

# This works!! And produces a dataframe called all_consulting_jobs
#
# Now I just need to write the output in a csv format cf: the question:

#Write the data frame to a csv file called all_consulting_jobs.csv in the data folder.

write.csv(all_consulting_jobs, "all_consulting_jobs.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Create a shiny app - OPTIONAL

We have already worked with the data on electricity production and usage, GDP/capita and CO2/capita since 1990. You have to create a simple Shiny app, where a user chooses a country from a drop down list and a time interval between 1990 and 2020 and shiny outputs the following

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "electricity-shiny.png"), error = FALSE)
```

You can use chatGPT to get the basic layout of Shiny app, but you need to adjust the code it gives you. Ask chatGPT to create the Shiny app using the `gapminder` data and make up similar requests for the inputs/outpus you are thinking of deploying.

```{r}
# As noted above this question is optional. I have thus not included a solution in this homework document. I do plan to create a shiny app and present this in another form. I found the following tutorial on line that may be helpful to learn what is required of this shiny app creation:
# https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-app.html
#

```

# Deliverables

There is a lot of explanatory text, comments, etc. You do not need these, so delete them and produce a stand-alone document that you could share with someone. Knit the edited and completed R Markdown (Rmd) file as a Word or HTML document (use the "Knit" button at the top of the script editor window) and upload it to Canvas. You must be commiting and pushing your changes to your own Github repo as you go along.

# Details

-   Who did you collaborate with: No-one although I asked the course professor a handful of questions once I felt that I was close with the final answer but was seemingly missing a small trick or there was a minor issue; or in one case, where I was totally stuck and needed freeing with a bit of code to understand the issue and catalyse me to propel forward.
-   Approximately how much time did you spend on this problem set: 2.5 days
-   What, if anything, gave you the most trouble: I found it hard to work out when to collect and, additionally, where specifically in the code one should place a collect(). I couldn't open the covid data on my laptop even when using arrow. Thus, I could not answer this question. I found it difficult to understand what exactly was being asked by the skywestminster questions; once I could comprehend the actual question, I could manage the coding, albeit I initially struggled with the group and ungroup tricks which are important in the earlier questions about this database. That said, I now feel that I understand the grouping and ungrouping concepts within a stream of code and so I have learnt well from this exercise on this account.

# Rubric

13/13: Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output. Multiple Github commits. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.

8/13: Problem set is 60--80% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). A few Github commits.

5/13: Problem set is less than 60% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. No Github commits.
